# 🧠 Brain Surface Hole Closing – Internship Project

Automaticaly close an open mesh with a plane and headband. Also does a scalar-field transfer for brain meshes.

This project provides a full workflow to:

1. **Automatically detect and close planar (or nearly planar) openings in a 3D mesh**,
2. **Generate triangulated caps** using projection, seeding, and constrained Delaunay triangulation,
3. **Copy all per-vertex scalar data** (e.g., thickness, curvature, sulcal depth) from the original open mesh to the closed mesh.
4. **Calculate the volume of closed meshes**, it make sure the new mesh is watertight. You can compute the volume with compute_volume.py or the pyvista option

# 🧠 Brain Data for the Project

You can download the meshes used during development from the official BraDiPho dataset:

🔗 **BraDiPho – Brain Digital Fossils Archive**
https://bradipho.eu/6-download.html

All specimens and epochs are publicly available and easy to download.

The folder `brain_data` also contains the **first epoch** of a specimen along with its **texture file**.
These two files are confirmed to work well with the full pipeline and are ideal for a **quick test run** of the scripts.

# 📦 Installation

Create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Main libraries:

- pyvista
- numpy
- scipy
- shapely
- trimesh
- matplotlib
- vtk

---

# 🏃 Quick Test Run

This part explains how to run the full hole-closing and scalar-transfer pipeline starting from a clean environment.

```bash
# Create environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Close holes
python close_opening_scripts/close_planar_hole.py \
    -i ../brain_data/sub-02_epo-01_ref-01_mesh.ply \
    -o ../brain_data/closed_solid/output.ply \
    --meshFilter 1e-5 \
    --debug ../brain_data/closed_solid/

# Transfer scalar fields
python utils/copy_colors.py
```

You can now view the closed mesh in Cloudcompare or MeshLab. You can find the closed mesh in brain_data/closed_solid. The interesting files for this quick test run are: `output.ply` and `output_scalar_fields.ply`.

If you don't have Cloudcompare or MeshLab, I made a quick viewer for you. All you need to do is type in the terminal:

```bash
./view_ply.sh
```

NOTE: You will be able to see the closed mesh followed by the closed mesh with his scalars fields once you closed the first opened window.

# 🔧 Cap Closing Algorithm (`close_planar_hole.py`)

This script **automatically closes open boundary loops** in a triangulated mesh.

### How it works

1. Detect boundary loops
2. Fit a plane via **SVD** on loop vertices
3. Project loop points onto the plane
4. Generate a 2D sampling grid
5. Filter seeds inside polygon offsets
6. Perform constrained **Delaunay triangulation**
7. Keep only triangles inside the loop
8. Generate a side band
9. Merge caps into the mesh
10. Recompute normals

### Run

python close_opening_scripts/close_planar_hole.py \
 -i brain_data/sub-02_epo-01_ref-01_mesh.ply \
 -o brain_data/closed_solid/output.ply

---

# 🎨 Scalar Transfer Tool (`copy_color.py`)

Transfers **all per-vertex scalar arrays** from the open mesh to the newly closed mesh using **KD-Tree nearest-neighbor mapping**.

### Run

python utils/copy_color.py

Output:

brain_data/closed_solid/output_scalar_fields.ply

---

# ▶️ Full Workflow

### 1. Close the holes

python close_opening_scripts/close_planar_hole.py \
 -i brain_data/sub-02_epo-01_ref-01_mesh.ply \
 -o brain_data/closed_solid/output.ply \
 --debug brain_data/debug/

### 2. Transfer scalar fields

python utils/copy_color.py

### 3. Visualize in CloudCompare, MeshLab, or PyVista

---

# 🧪 Debug Outputs

When using `--debug`, the script exports:

- boundary loops
- projected loops
- grid seeds
- filtered seeds
- triangulation
- side band
- remaining open edges

These outputs help inspect and validate each internal step.

# 📘 Examples

### Example 1 — Close holes with filtering and debug output

python close_opening_scripts/close_planar_hole.py \
 -i brain_data/sub-02_epo-01_ref-01_mesh.ply \
 -o brain_data/closed_solid/output.ply \
 --meshFilter 1e-5 \
 --debug brain_data/debug/

### Example 2 — Generate caps only

python close_opening_scripts/close_planar_hole.py \
 -i brain_data/sub-02_epo-01_ref-01_mesh.ply \
 -o brain_data/closed_solid/caps_only.ply \
 --capsOnly

### Example 3 — Transfer curvature/thickness fields

python utils/copy_color.py \
 -s brain_data/sub-02_epo-01_ref-01_mesh.ply \
 -t brain_data/closed_solid/output.ply \
 -o brain_data/closed_solid/output_scalar_fields.ply

# ⚠️ Limitations / Known Issues

### 🔹 1. Smaller opening meshes increase debug output size

My algorithm works really well with larger holes. But when it finds smaller one it has trouble closing them.

### 🔹 2. Issue with the BraDiPho Meshes with epochs disection

As soon as disections comme in consideration, the meshes found on the BraDiPho website have structural holes, floting islands & the meshes are fractured in smallers surfaces. It is impacting my code making the reconstruction invalid for the moment.

### 🔹 3. Works best for planar or near-planar holes

Highly curved openings may distort projection or triangulation.

### 🔹 4. Sensitive to boundary noise

Meshes with extremely short or irregular edges should be pre-filtered using `--meshFilter`.

### 🔹 5. Warped openings get a curved cap

The planar cap needs the opening to project onto its best-fit plane as a simple (non self-intersecting) polygon. When it does not, the opening is closed with a curved (harmonic) cap instead and a `WARNING` is printed. Such a cap is not flat, which slightly changes how the closed volume is defined at that opening.

The planar cap is placed on the outer side of the opening, at its highest point; it therefore adds a small wedge of volume (typically under 1 %, up to ~3 % on very warped openings).

### 🔹 6. Scalar transfer uses nearest-neighbor

This may smooth or blur sharp scalar variations.
Future improvement: weighted or barycentric interpolation.

### 🔹 7. Large meshes increase debug output size

The triangulation and debug exports scale with mesh size.

# 🚀 Future Work / Enhancements

### 🔧 Algorithmic Improvements

- **Adaptive seeding strategies**
  Increase sampling density near the boundary, reduce it inside. (reduce the over estimation of the volume)

- **Weighted scalar transfer**
  Replace nearest-neighbor with inverse-distance or barycentric interpolation.

- **Small hole handlers**
  I still need to find a way to adapt the script to handle diferently smaller holes.

### 🎨 Mesh Quality Enhancements

- **Pre-closing mesh clean up**
  To make the reconstruction valid on epochs with disection, we need a way to fuse the seperated surfaces of the mesh in a clean way. being able to get rid of the structural holes & floating island would also be a must.

- **Post-cap smoothing** (Taubin, Laplacian, or HC smoothing)
  Improves blending between cap and original surface.

- **Side-band optimization**
  Reduce long triangles by adding local remeshing.
